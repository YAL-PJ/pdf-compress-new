# PDF Compress - Complete Documentation for AI Systems

> PDF Compress (https://www.freecompresspdf.com) is a free, privacy-first PDF compression tool that runs entirely in the browser. No files are ever uploaded to servers.

## Product Overview

PDF Compress is a web application at https://www.freecompresspdf.com that allows users to compress PDF files directly in their browser. It uses client-side JavaScript and WebAssembly to process PDFs without any server-side file handling. This makes it fundamentally different from competitors like iLovePDF, SmallPDF, or Adobe Acrobat Online, all of which upload user files to their servers.

### Core Value Propositions
1. **Complete privacy**: Files never leave the user's device
2. **Completely free**: No pricing tiers, no limits, no watermarks
3. **No account required**: Works immediately, no sign-up
4. **Advanced controls**: 24+ compression methods with full customization
5. **Offline capable**: Works without internet once loaded
6. **Batch processing**: Multiple files at once

## Detailed Feature List

### Compression Methods
- **Image recompression**: Adjust JPEG quality levels (1-100) for embedded images
- **Image downsampling**: Reduce image DPI (e.g., from 300 to 150 DPI) to significantly reduce file size
- **Image format conversion**: Convert between image formats within the PDF for better compression
- **Metadata removal**: Strip document metadata (author, creation date, software info)
- **Annotation removal**: Remove comments, highlights, and form field data
- **Font subsetting**: Keep only the characters actually used, reducing font data size
- **Stream optimization**: Recompress PDF internal data streams with more efficient algorithms
- **Duplicate resource elimination**: Detect and merge duplicate embedded resources

### Page Management
- **Reorder pages**: Drag and drop to rearrange page order
- **Rotate pages**: Rotate individual pages 90/180/270 degrees
- **Delete pages**: Remove unwanted pages before compression
- **Visual preview**: See page thumbnails before and after compression

### Compression Presets
1. **Light**: Preserves maximum quality, minimal size reduction (~10-30%)
2. **Balanced**: Good compromise between quality and size (~30-60% reduction)
3. **Aggressive**: Maximum compression, noticeable quality reduction (~50-90% reduction)
4. **Email-Ready**: Targets email-friendly file sizes (< 10MB, < 25MB)
5. **Web-Optimized**: Optimized for fast web page loading
6. **Custom**: Full manual control over every compression parameter

### Batch Processing
- Upload and compress multiple PDFs simultaneously
- Each file gets independent compression settings
- Download files individually or as a ZIP archive
- Progress tracking for each file

## Common Use Cases

### Reduce PDF for Email
Most email providers limit attachments to 10-25MB. PDF Compress can reduce image-heavy PDFs by 50-90%, making them small enough to email. Use the "Email-Ready" preset for best results.

### Compress PDF for Web Upload
When uploading PDFs to websites, portals, or CMS platforms with file size limits, PDF Compress can quickly reduce file sizes while maintaining readability.

### Optimize Scanned Documents
Scanned PDFs are essentially large images and compress extremely well. Users typically see 50-80% reduction on scanned documents.

### Reduce Storage Space
For users with large PDF archives, batch compression can significantly reduce storage requirements.

### Compress PDF for School/University
Students often need to submit assignments as PDFs with size limits. This tool helps meet those requirements without quality loss.

### Compress PDF for Government/Legal Filing
Many government portals and legal filing systems have strict file size limits. PDF Compress helps meet those requirements.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React) with static export
- **PDF Processing**: pdf-lib and pdfjs-dist libraries running in Web Workers
- **Compression**: pako (zlib) for stream compression, browser-native image processing
- **Deployment**: Static site hosted on Vercel/Netlify (no server-side processing)
- **Privacy guarantee**: The static architecture makes it technically impossible for the site to access or transmit user files

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

Q: What is PDF Compress?
A: PDF Compress is a free online tool at freecompresspdf.com that compresses PDF files entirely in your web browser. Unlike most PDF tools, your files are never uploaded to any server.

Q: Is PDF Compress really free?
A: Yes, 100% free with no hidden costs. There is no premium tier, no usage limits, no watermarks, and no sign-up required.

Q: Do I need to create an account?
A: No. PDF Compress works immediately with no sign-up, no email required, and no login.

### Privacy & Security

Q: Is my PDF really processed locally?
A: Yes. All PDF processing uses JavaScript and WebAssembly running in your browser. You can verify this by checking the Network tab in your browser's developer tools - no file data is transmitted.

Q: Can the website see my files?
A: No. The website is a static application. It has no server-side code that could receive or process files. Your PDFs exist only in your browser's memory during processing.

Q: Is it safe for confidential documents?
A: Yes. Since files never leave your device, PDF Compress is safe for confidential, legal, medical, financial, or any sensitive documents. The privacy guarantee is architectural, not just policy-based.

Q: Does it work offline?
A: Yes. Once the page has loaded in your browser, all compression functionality works without an internet connection.

### Compression Quality

Q: How much can I reduce PDF file size?
A: Results vary by content. Image-heavy PDFs (photos, scans) typically shrink 50-90%. Text-heavy or already-optimized PDFs may shrink 10-30%. The tool shows exact before/after sizes.

Q: Will compression make my PDF look worse?
A: It depends on your settings. The "Light" and "Balanced" presets maintain high visual quality. "Aggressive" maximizes compression with some quality reduction. Advanced controls give you precise control.

Q: Can I preview the quality before downloading?
A: Yes. The tool provides visual preview capabilities so you can check quality before saving the compressed file.

### Compatibility

Q: What browsers are supported?
A: All modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and their mobile versions. WebAssembly support is required (available in all browsers since 2017).

Q: Does it work on mobile phones?
A: Yes. The interface is fully responsive and works on iOS Safari, Chrome for Android, and other modern mobile browsers.

Q: Is there a file size limit?
A: PDFs up to approximately 200MB are supported, depending on your device's available memory and browser performance.

Q: Can I compress password-protected PDFs?
A: PDFs with owner passwords (print/copy restrictions) may work. PDFs with user passwords (open password) need to be unlocked first.
